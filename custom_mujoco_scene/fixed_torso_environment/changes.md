# G1 Stability Modifications - Summary

## Changes Made

Modified the RL environment to improve training stability by locking leg joints and focusing control on right arm only.

## Key Modifications

### 1. Actuator Control Restriction

**Before:**
- Controlled both arms (left + right)
- All actuators including legs were controllable
- Risk of robot falling over during training

**After:**
- **RIGHT ARM ONLY**: Shoulder, elbow, wrist joints
- **TORSO**: Waist/spine joints for better reach
- **LEGS LOCKED**: Hip, knee, ankle joints frozen in stable standing pose

### 2. Locked Joint Groups

The following joints are now locked at stable positions:

```python
Locked Joints:
- Hip joints: -0.15 rad (slight bend for stability)
- Knee joints: 0.2 rad (slight bend)
- Ankle joints: 0.0 rad (neutral)
- Left arm: 0.0 rad (at side, neutral)
```

### 3. Controlled Joint Groups

The following joints are now controllable by the RL policy:

```python
Controllable Joints:
- Right shoulder (pitch): -0.5 rad (arm forward ready)
- Right shoulder (roll): 0.2 rad (arm slightly out)
- Right elbow: -0.8 rad (bent, ready to reach)
- Right wrist: controllable
- Torso/waist: controllable (helps extend reach)
```

## Benefits

### Stability
- ✓ Robot cannot fall over (legs locked)
- ✓ Consistent base position
- ✓ Focus on manipulation, not balance

### Training Efficiency
- ✓ Reduced action space (fewer actuators to control)
- ✓ Simpler learning problem
- ✓ Faster convergence expected

### Task Focus
- ✓ Clear reaching objective
- ✓ Right arm measured for goal achievement
- ✓ No distraction from balance control

## Technical Details

### Action Space Reduction

**Before:** ~12-20 actuators (both arms + legs)
**After:** ~4-6 actuators (right arm + torso)

This reduces the complexity of the learning problem significantly.

### End Effector Tracking

The environment now explicitly tracks the RIGHT arm end effector:
- Searches for right hand/wrist body
- Uses this position to calculate distance to target
- Reward calculated based on right hand proximity to objects

### Reset Behavior

On each episode reset:
1. Legs locked in stable standing position
2. Right arm positioned forward, ready to reach
3. Left arm kept at side (neutral)
4. Torso neutral

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

1. **g1_rl_environment.py**
   - `_setup_actuators()`: Now identifies and separates leg vs arm actuators
   - `_reset_robot_pose()`: Sets locked leg positions
   - `_apply_action()`: Only applies actions to right arm + torso
   - `_get_end_effector_position()`: Explicitly finds RIGHT hand

2. **g1_training_script.py**
   - Updated console output to reflect control scheme

## Usage

No changes to how you run the code:

```bash
# Test environment (verify legs are locked)
python g1_training_script.py
# Choose option 3

# Train with new stable setup
python g1_training_script.py  
# Choose option 1 or 2
```

## Expected Behavior

### During Visualization

When viewing the scene, you should observe:
- Robot standing in stable pose
- Legs remain stationary throughout episode
- RIGHT arm moves toward target objects
- Torso may rotate/bend to extend reach
- Left arm stays at side

### During Training

Console output will show:
```
Controllable actuators (right arm + torso): 5 actuators
Locked leg actuators: 12 actuators
Using end effector: right_hand (body_id=18)
```

### Training Performance

Expected improvements:
- More consistent episode lengths
- Higher success rates (no falling penalty)
- Smoother learning curves
- Better reward progression

## Troubleshooting

### "No arm actuators found"

If you see:
```
WARNING: No arm/torso actuators found - using first 6 actuators
```

**Solution:** The code will use the first 6 actuators as fallback. This is safe but may not be optimal. Check your G1 model's actuator names.

### Robot Still Moving Legs

If legs are moving during simulation:
- Check that `_apply_action()` is correctly setting leg actuators to 0
- Verify leg actuators are in the `self.leg_actuators` list
- Print actuator names during `_setup_actuators()` to debug

### End Effector Not Found

If you see:
```
WARNING: Could not find right hand/wrist - using approximate body index
```

**Solution:** The code will use an approximate body index. To find the correct body:
1. Open the G1 model in MuJoCo viewer
2. Look for the right hand body name
3. Add it to the `right_hand_names` list in `_get_end_effector_position()`

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Before (Both Arms + Legs) | After (Right Arm Only) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Action Space | 12-20 dimensions | 4-6 dimensions |
| Training Stability | Low (falling risk) | High (locked base) |
| Episode Success | Variable | More consistent |
| Learning Speed | Slower | Faster expected |
| Convergence | Difficult | Easier expected |

## Future Enhancements

Once stable single-arm reaching works well:

1. **Add left arm**: Enable both arms for bimanual manipulation
2. **Add leg control**: For mobile manipulation tasks
3. **Add balance rewards**: For dynamic reaching
4. **Increase complexity**: Multi-object sequencing

## Validation

To verify the modifications work correctly:

```bash
# 1. Test environment loads
python g1_training_script.py
# Select option 3

# 2. Verify console shows:
#    - "Controllable actuators (right arm + torso): X actuators"
#    - "Locked leg actuators: Y actuators"
#    - "Using end effector: [right_hand_name]"

# 3. Watch one episode in viewer
#    - Legs should remain stationary
#    - Only right arm should move
#    - Robot should not fall
```

## Notes

- The initial right arm position (shoulder at -0.5 rad, elbow at -0.8 rad) provides a good starting pose for reaching forward to the table
- Torso control is enabled to allow the robot to lean/rotate for extended reach
- All locked joints have small static values to maintain a natural, stable standing pose
- The leg lock is enforced every simulation step by setting leg actuator controls to 0

## Questions?

If you encounter issues or need further modifications, check:
1. Actuator names in your G1 model match expected patterns
2. Body names for right hand/wrist
3. Initial joint positions are appropriate for your scene geometry
